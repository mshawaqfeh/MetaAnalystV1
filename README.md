# MetaAnalystV1

## Introduction
MetaAnalyst is a free, user-friendly software package for metagenomic biomarker detection and phenotype classification. MetaAnalyst provides the following functionalities as an efficient analysis tool for metagenomic biomarker detection and phenotype classification:
1.	Accepts seven different types of input files.
2.	Supports multilevel labeling that enables researchers to analyze the data from different perspectives (i.e., under various conditions) smoothly. 
3.	Provides a variety of pre-processing procedures before downstream statistical analysis.
4.	Includes about 28 biomarker detection algorithms and 4 classifiers
5.	Provides three criteria for evaluating the performance of biomarker detection algorithms:
a.	Supervised classification performance: MetaAnalyst computes the overall classification accuracy (ACC), balanced accuracy (BACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPC), miss classification rate (MCR), receiver operation curve (ROC), and area under the curve (AUC).
b.	Unsupervised clustering performance
c.	Consensus performance
6.	Generate the output in tab-delimited files and publication quality plots with various formatting capabilities.
The MetaAnalyst software is implemented using Matlab R2021a and it is available freely as a stand-alone package for Windows and Linux operating systems at: https://github.com/mshawaqfeh/MetaAnalystV1 
## Requirements
MetaAnalyst is a standalone desktop application, written in MATLAB and does not require any additional packages to install. MetaAnalyst runs on Microsoft Windows and Linux.
